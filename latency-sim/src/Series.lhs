# Appendix: Power series representing distributions

<a name="series">Here</a>
we follow [@PowerSeries] exposition of power series,
but use use finite series and shortcut evaluation:
```{.haskell .literate}
-- | Series contain the same information as lists.
--   We can also define lexicographic ordering on them.
newtype Series a = Series { unSeries :: [a] }
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```
Generating function of :
$$ F(t)=f_0*t^0+f_1*t^1+f_2*t^2+...+f_n*t^n $$
is represented by the Haskell data structure:
```{.literate}
f_t = Series [a0, a1, ..., an]
```

```{.haskell .literate}
-- | Cumulative sums computes sums of 1..n-th term of the series
cumsum :: Num a => Series a -> Series a
cumsum = Series
       . tail -- drop uninformative zero at the beginning of result
       . scanl (+) 0
       . unSeries

-- | Differential encoding is lossless
--   correspondent of discrete differences, but with
--   first coefficient being copied.
--   (Like there was fake zero before the series,
--    to preserve information about first term.)
--
--   That makes it an inverse of `cumsum`.
diffEnc :: Num a => Series a -> Series a
diffEnc (Series []) = Series []
diffEnc (Series s ) = Series $ head s : zipWith (-) (tail s) s
```
This serves to get cumulants:
```{.haskell .literate .ignored}
test_simpleCumsum  = cumsum [1,1,1] == ([1,2,3] :: Series Int)
test_simpleCumsum2 = cumsum [1,2,3] == ([1,3,6] :: Series Int)
test_cumsumIsLeftAdjointOfDiffEnc  x = cumsum  (diffEnc x) == x
test_cumsumIsRightAdjointOfDiffEnc x = diffEnc (cumsum  x) == x
```
So that `diffEnc` of CDF will get PDF,
and `cumsum` of PDF will get CDF.

subrem = Series . scanl (-) 1 . unSeries

$$ F(t)=f_0*t^0+f_1*t^1+f_2*t^2+...+f_n*t^n $$
Convolution:
$$F(t)*G(t)=\Sigma_{0}^t x^t*(f_0*g_t+f_1*g_{t-1}+...+g_0*f_t) $$
Wikipedia's definition:
$$(f * g)(t) \triangleq\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau.$$
Distribution is from $0$ to $+\infty$:
Wikipedia's definition:

1. First we fix the boundaries of integration: $$(f * g)(t) \triangleq\ \int_{0}^\infty f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau.$$
(Assuming $f(t)=g(t)=0$ when $t<0$.)

2. Now we change to discrete form:

$$(f * g)(t) \triangleq\ \Sigma_{0}^\infty f(\tau) g(t - \tau)$$

3. Now we notice that we approximate functions up to term $n$:
$$(f * g)(t) \triangleq\ \Sigma_{0}^{n} f_{\tau} g_{t - \tau}.$$

Resulting in convolution:
$$F(t)*G(t)=\Sigma_{0}^t x^t*(f_0*g_t+f_1*g_{t-1}+...+g_0*f_t) $$
