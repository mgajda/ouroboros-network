The main purpose of this article is to explain homological technique in commutative algebra by studying the notion of depth by means of Ext and by applying it to a problem of linear equations, namely the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud criterion of exactness of finite free complexes. Our second purpose is to present a homological version of Eagon-Northcott theory of (polynomial) depth."

abstract = "Closed semirings are algebraic structures that provide a unified approach to a number of seemingly unrelated problems of computer science and operations research. For example, semirings can be used to describe the algebra related to regular expressions, graph-theoretical path problems, and linear equations. We present a new axiomatic formulation of closed semirings. We introduce the concept of eliminant, which simplifies the treatment of closed semirings considerably and yields very simple proofs of otherwise difficult theorems. We use eliminants to define matrix closure, formulate closure algorithms, and prove their correctness."

abstract = "This paper studies an interesting graph measure that we call the effective graph resistance. The notion of effective graph resistance is derived from the field of electric circuit analysis where it is defined as the accumulated effective resistance between all pairs of vertices. The objective of the paper is twofold. First, we survey known formulae of the effective graph resistance and derive other representations as well. The derivation of new expressions is based on the analysis of the associated random walk on the graph and applies tools from Markov chain theory. This approach results in a new method to approximate the effective graph resistance. A second objective of this paper concerns the optimisation of the effective graph resistance for graphs with given number of vertices and diameter, and for optimal edge addition. A set of analytical results is described, as well as results obtained by exhaustive search. One of the foremost applications of the effective graph resistance we have in mind, is the analysis of robustness-related problems. However, with our discussion of this informative graph measure we hope to open up a wealth of possibilities of applying the effective graph resistance to all kinds of networks problems."
